# Adonate

# Solution
Adonate is a mobile application, which aims to facilitate the donation process, increase donor engagement, as well as the amount of donations and, consequently, cause social impact.
The app generally revolves around a marketplace of donation campaigns, these campaigns have detailed information about organizations and tags that discriminate against their cause and the type of item being collected.

# Adonate api
  This project is the back end of the Adonate application, where the django python framework and all google cloud appengine infrastructure were used.

Currently api is disabled because of the spend of keeping active the application running on google cloud servers
